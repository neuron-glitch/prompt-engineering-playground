## 📚 Curriculum Overview

### Level 1 — Prompt Basics `8–10 hrs`
How LLMs work and why prompt quality matters. Vague vs specific comparisons with before/after analysis. The anatomy of a great prompt: Role, Task, Context, Format, Length, Tone. Universal prompt template with a structured exercise to fix broken prompts.

### Level 2 — Prompt Techniques `10–12 hrs`
Zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with trigger phrases. Role prompting with a reusable formula. Output format control: JSON, markdown tables, numbered lists, code blocks. Combination exercise to apply all techniques at once.

### Level 3 — Prompt Patterns `12–15 hrs`
Expert Persona, Recipe, Reflection, and Template Fill patterns. Prompt chaining for multi-step workflows. Meta-prompting — using AI to write better prompts for you. Pattern challenge exercise with a pattern identification quiz.

### Level 4 — Prompt Optimization `10–12 hrs`
Token efficiency techniques and cost reduction strategies. A/B testing framework for prompt comparison. Systematic debugging guide for bad AI responses. Live token counter lab with cost estimation. Prompt optimizer comparing verbose vs lean versions.

### Level 5 — Domain Applications `15–18 hrs`
Code prompts: write functions, debug errors, conduct code review. Content creation: blog posts, email copy, social media. Data analysis: sentiment analysis, structured extraction. Business templates: meeting summaries, status reports. Custom domain exercise to apply skills to your own field.

### Level 6 — Mastery `15–18 hrs`
Prompt safety and responsible AI ethics. Prompt injection attacks — what they are and how to defend against them. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) prompt patterns. Production deployment: versioning, monitoring, caching, fallbacks. Evaluation frameworks and automated testing pipelines. A reflective Journey Complete section celebrating what learners have built.

## 🛠️ Customisation Guide

### Change a Level's Color Theme

Each level page has a color override at the top of its `<style>` block. For example, to change Level 1's color from cyan to teal:

```css
/* In level1.html */
.level-hero h1 { background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fff 30%, #00bfa5); ... }
.tab.active { color: #00bfa5 !important; border-color: rgba(0,191,165,.4) !important; }
```

### Add a New Tab to Any Level

1. Add a `<button class="tab">` inside the `.tabs` div
2. Add a `<div class="lesson-content" id="lX_tN">` with your content
3. Update the tab count in the `LEVELS_CONFIG` object in `shared.js`

### Adjust the Prompt Scoring Logic

Edit the `scorePrompt()` function in `shared.js` to change how prompts are evaluated. Scoring checks for length, format keywords, role definition, tone language, and structural elements.

### Translate to Another Language

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a folder named with the language code (e.g., `te/` for Telugu, `hi/` for Hindi)
3. Copy and translate the HTML files — shared.css and shared.js do not need translation
4. Submit a Pull Request
